# Reason for discontinuing
1. It's ugly and poorly designed; even I don't want to use it.
2. Its code structure is very bad; I feel reluctant to work on it.
3. I find an alternative freeware, which can do basically everything this thing can do, but better. I will create another software, polish it, and won't release it until it's better than the alternative I use now.
